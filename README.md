This project involves creating a comprehensive data analysis dashboard using Power BI to visualize the survival data of passengers on the Titanic.
The dashboard provides insights into various factors that influenced survival rates, including gender, passenger class, age, and embarkation point.

The dashboard includes the following key visualizations:

Survival by Gender:
Visual representation of survival rates based on gender.
Insights show that females had a higher survival rate compared to males.

Survival by Embarkment:
Analysis of survival rates based on the point of embarkation (S=Southampton, C=Cherbourg, Q=Queenstown).
Highlights survival statistics for each embarkation point.

Survival by Class:
Visualization of survival rates across different passenger classes (1st , 2nd , 3rd).
First-class passengers had the highest survival rate.

Sum of Survived by Age and Gender:
A line graph depicting the survival count distributed across different age groups and gender.
Helps in understanding the age distribution of survivors.

Survival Rate by Gender:
Pie chart showing the percentage of survival rates between males and females.
Provides a quick visual insight into gender-based survival statistics.

Controls:
Interactive controls to filter data based on gender, passenger class, and embarkation point.
Allows for dynamic and personalized data exploration.

How to Use?
Open the Dashboard:
Load the Power BI dashboard file into Power BI Desktop or Power BI Service.

Interactivity:
Use the controls on the right side to filter the data based on specific criteria such as gender, passenger class, and embarkation point.
Hover over the visualizations to see detailed data points and insights.

Insights:
Analyze the visualizations to draw insights about the factors influencing survival rates on the Titanic.
Use the dashboard to support data-driven conclusions and hypotheses.

Data Source:
The dataset used for this analysis is the Titanic dataset, which is publicly available and widely used for data science projects. It includes information about the passengers such as age, gender, passenger class, and survival status.
